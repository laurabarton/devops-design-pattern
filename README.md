# devops-design-pattern

- This repository is a couple of examples of how to apply design patterns to infrastructure automation code.  These examples were presented during the September DevOps DC Meetup.  

- These are not solely my own.  They come from other documenation and examples I have found on the web as well as ideas gathered while collaborating with other people.
